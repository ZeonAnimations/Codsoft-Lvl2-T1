        <p>Alexander (June 1, 1999 – June 2022[a]), known online as Technoblade, was an American YouTuber known for his Minecraft videos, livestreams, and involvement in the Dream SMP. Technoblade registered his main channel on YouTube in 2013. His videos consisted primarily of Minecraft gameplay, particularly on the minigame server Hypixel. After rising to popularity in 2019 for his performances in player versus player (PvP) events, Technoblade was invited to the Dream SMP Minecraft server in 2020, further increasing his following.</p>

        <h2>Early Life and Background</h2>
        <p>Born on June 1, 1999,[31] Technoblade resided in San Francisco, California.[32] He was known to have had ADHD.[33] In a 2018 video, he revealed he would begin attending college as an English major.[34] However, in a later 2019 video, he announced that he dropped out of college to play Minecraft full-time.Throughout his career, Technoblade avoided personal inquiries and interviews to maintain his and his family's privacy, although he occasionally discussed his personal life in his videos. His family continued to decline interviews after his death. By his own admission, Technoblade and a sibling deceived his viewers in a now-deleted video from 2016 into believing his name was "Dave". This was generally accepted as his real name until the announcement of his death, in which he revealed his name was Alexander.</p>

        <h2>Career</h2>
        <p>Before Technoblade created his main YouTube channel, he had another channel named "StudioLore", on which he posted a few times and on an irregular basis. The channel featured low-quality Team Fortress 2 videos and Roblox Sword Fight On The Heights videos. Technoblade was around the age of 10 when he started publishing videos on this channel.</p>
        <p>Technoblade's first Minecraft video was posted on another channel named "Derp Squad". The channel was created specifically for collaborations with his brother but was abandoned when the "Technoblade" channel was made. All the videos on this channel were uploaded in August 2013 and about a month later the “StudioLore” channel went inactive. This happened roughly two months before the creation of the "Technoblade" channel.</p>
        <p>In the past, Technoblade mostly uploaded Blitz Survival Games. His 500th episode special, titled "Ultimate Hunger Games," was his most-viewed video before he gained more popularity. He has also made older videos of himself cooking and other green screen content showing his YouTube awards. Hypixel continues to be his main means of obtaining views."Technoblade’s first-ever video dates back to November 1, 2013."</p>
        <p>Technoblade was well-known throughout the Minecraft community for his skill in PVP or player-versus-player combat. He has earned the [PIG+++] rank on Hypixel for winning the Minecraft Monday tournament four times, more than any other YouTuber. He has collaborated many times with other famous YouTubers, many of whom have been through Minecraft Monday, some of whom were his teammates during the event.</p>
        <p>In late November 2019, he joined a Minecraft server named SMP Earth, a Factions server where an assortment of YouTubers play survival mode on a 3000:1 recreation of the Earth. Technoblade had also begun streaming different games aside from Minecraft, such as the popular Minecraft spin-off "Minecraft Story Mode", and "Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord". During the Potato War, Technoblade made multiple alternative Minecraft accounts such as Asiyn, Whitelisted, Whitelisted 2, PommesDeTerre, NoHaxCanJustFly, Ender_Gamer09, and BizarreZzz.</p>
        <p>Technoblade also played Hypixel's version of Skyblock, often featuring his friends and co-op members, such as Jiyn, TimeDeo, and xHascox. Technoblade had made an entire series of Hypixel Skyblock and is well-known for being "the fastest man in skyblock," as well as for his three-part Potato War saga in which he fought user Im_a_squid_kid for the #1 potato rank.</p>
        <p>He had competed in Minecraft Mondays and the MC Championship. He also owns the accounts Whitelisted, BizzarreZz, PommesDeTerre, and Whitelisted2 (currently known as MrBeastGoon27) as shown in his Great Potato War videos. Those were shown in his "Bedwars youtube event with AciDic BliTzz, Mydoeza, ShadowApples, a lot of people really” video.</p>
        <p>He also owns the account coolperson147, as mentioned in his “The art of a balanced breakfast - survival games montage” video. Technoblade also owned the account Technogrenade, used in the "Alt Account! - Solo Skywars #12" video back in 2016, as well as SuspicousPIgman.</p>
        <p>Technoblade joined the Dream SMP on September 23, 2020. He coined himself as an Anarchist and was convinced by TommyInnit and Wilbur Soot to help them overthrow the corrupt government of the nation of L'Manburg, led by jschlatt and Quackity. However, when Tommy's side thought the war was over, Wilbur pressed a button that set off loads of buried TNT, which resulted in large-scale destruction.</p>
        <p>In 2019, Technoblade participated in Keemstar's Minecraft event, Minecraft Mondays, where YouTubers and streamers would come together to play a wide variety of minigames, and the prize for winning was set as $10,000 to be split amongst the first-place team, changed to $5,000 past week three.

The tournament consisted of 10 teams and 40 players, featuring a variety of custom minigames. The prize is a special MCC coin by Noxcrew.</p>

        <h2>Impact and Influence</h2>
        <p>We are deeply saddened by the loss of gamer and influencer Technoblade. His generosity and selflessness were evident when he rallied his followers to raise, to date, over $1 million for SFA and sarcoma research. Reading the many tributes left to him online we know he was beloved by his millions of fans. We are overwhelmed by the outpouring of love, support, and generosity and want to thank everyone who made donations in his honor. If you would still like to donate, we ask that you use this page to make your gift. We will honor Technoblade, now known to the world as Alex, by using funds raised to continue to fund research in his name.  

            SFA honored Technoblade with our Courage Award at our Stand Up to Sarcoma Gala on September 28, 2022, in New York City. The Courage Award is given annually to sarcoma survivors or advocates who illustrate, through their personal efforts and actions, sarcoma advocacy. Alex continues to have a tremendous impact on increasing awareness and advancing research. He used his significant platform on behalf of sarcoma patients and survivors to create hope and a better life for people diagnosed with sarcoma. Techno created a legacy that will impact generations of sarcoma patients.
            
            At the gala, with the support of Technoblade’s parents, SFA established the Technoblade Memorial Research Award. The first award was made in the summer of 2022 for research into treatment of osteosarcoma-lung metastasis.
            
            Technoblade was a shining example of a Courage Award honoree. He will be forever in our hearts for his valiant battle with sarcoma. If he were here, he would tell all others fighting cancer: “Keep Your Head Up King.” </p>
